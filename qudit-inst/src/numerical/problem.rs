//! This module defines the `Problem` trait and associated traits for defining optimization problems.
//!
//! Any object implementing the `Problem` trait and some associated `ProvidesX` traits defines how an
//! `OptimizationStrategy` can build the associated methods necessary for optimization. Certain optimizers
//! and strategies will require specific capabilities and will fail to compile if not provided.
//! This design is for performance reasons. Some problems may be computationally expensive to build as well as evaluate.
//! The separation of a `Problem` from the `Function` it generates allows performance optimizations in these cases.
